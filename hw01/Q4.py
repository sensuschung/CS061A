Q4: Hailstone
Douglas Hofstadter's Pulitzer-prize-winning book, GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach, poses the following mathematical puzzle.

Pick a positive integer n as the start.
If n is even, divide it by 2.
If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
Continue this process until n is 1.
The number n will travel up and down but eventually end at 1 (at least for all numbers that have ever been tried -- nobody has ever proved that the sequence will terminate). Analogously, a hailstone travels up and down in the atmosphere before eventually landing on earth.

This sequence of values of n is often called a Hailstone sequence. Write a function that takes a single argument with formal parameter name n, prints out the hailstone sequence starting at n, and returns the number of steps in the sequence:
'''

def hailstone(n):
    """Print the hailstone sequence starting at n and return its
    length.

    >>> a = hailstone(10)
    10
    5
    16
    8
    4
    2
    1
    >>> a
    7
    >>> b = hailstone(1)
    1
    >>> b
    1
    """
    while n != 1 :
        print(n)
        if n % 2 == 0 :
            n = n // 2
        else :
            n = n * 3 + 1
    print(n)
        
'''
better version: using lists to store the hailstone sequence
    sequence = [n]
    while n != 1 :
        if n % 2 == 0 :
            n = int(n / 2)
        else :
            n = n * 3 + 1
        sequence.append(n)
    print(sequence)
